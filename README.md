# Instant API Documentation & Testing for Spring Boot — Zero Config, Always Live.

Retreever is a **lightweight, developer-first toolkit** that automatically **discovers, documents, and tests** your Spring Boot APIs — *without a single manual annotation or YAML file.*

It scans your controllers, request/response models, validation constraints, and exception handlers to build a **complete, accurate, always-up-to-date** API documentation model.

Think of it as **Swagger + Postman → merged, modernized, and simplified.**
Just add the dependency, start your app, and open:

```
/retreever
```

Done. Your entire API surface is ready — documented, organized, and instantly testable.

# ✨ Why Retreever?

Unlike Swagger/OpenAPI tools that require 20 lines of annotations per endpoint *and* a separate Postman collection you manually maintain, Retreever does all the work for you.

### Retreever gives you:

1.  ✔ **Automatic docs** (no annotation clutter)
2.  ✔ **Automatic examples** (via annotations + constraints)
3.  ✔ **Accurate generic resolution** (even nested)
4.  ✔ **Automatic error mapping** (directly from your exception handlers)
5.  ✔ **A modern Postman-like testing UI**
6.  ✔ **Zero YAML, zero configuration**
7.  ✔ **Reflection-accurate request & response schemas**
8.  ✔ **Blazing fast output (~30ms)**
9.  ✔ **A tiny JSON document (~45KB) for complex ~70 endpoint resolution**

Just write normal Spring code — Retreever fills in everything else.

# 🚀 Features

## ⚡ Zero Configuration

Drop it in your Spring Boot app. Retreever automatically discovers:

* `@RestController` classes
* Request bodies (`@RequestBody`)
* Response types (`ResponseEntity<T>` and raw DTOs)
* Path variables, query params, and headers
* Validation annotations
* Exception handlers (`@ExceptionHandler`)

No setup. No external config. No YAML.



## 🧩 Smart Schema Resolution

Automatically builds a predictable JSON schema for:

* Complex nested DTOs
* Lists, arrays, maps
* Records and plain classes
* Enums
* Nullable vs non-nullable fields
* Jakarta Validation constraints
* Field-level documentation (`@FieldInfo`)

Generic substitution is deeply supported:

```
ResponseEntity<Page<OrderItemResponse>>
```

…just works.


## 🛣️ Endpoint & Metadata Extraction

Every endpoint includes:

* HTTP method
* Full resolved path
* Params (path, query, header)
* Consumes / produces media types
* Security flags (`secured=true`, `@PreAuthorize`)
* Developer-friendly name & description (`@ApiEndpoint`)

Grouped automatically using `@ApiGroup`.



## ❗ Automatic Error Mapping

Declare your error responses *once* where they belong — your `@RestControllerAdvice`.

Retreever extracts:

* Error type
* HTTP status
* Description
* Error body schema

Your documentation stays **fully consistent** with your real exception flow.

Swagger can’t do this.
SpringDoc can’t do this.
Retreever does.


## 📄 Clean, Stable Output Document

Every part of the system flows into a final immutable DTO:

```
ApiDocument
```

Containing:

* Metadata
* Groups
* Endpoints
* Request schemas
* Response schemas
* Example objects
* Errors
* Validation constraints


# 📦 Installation

(*Publishing to Maven Central in progress*)

Soon you’ll simply add:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.retreever</groupId>
    <artifactId>retreever</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```



# 📄 Example Output

```json
{
  "name": "Example API",
  "version": "v1",
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "Product APIs",
      "endpoints": [
        {
          "name": "Get Product",
          "method": "GET",
          "path": "/products/{id}",
          "request": { ... },
          "response": { ... },
          "errors": [ ... ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Clean. Predictable. Easy to render.

# Retreever Authentication

Retreever can protect only its own `/retreever/**` endpoints without requiring Spring Security in the library or host app.

Add credentials in the host application's properties:

```properties
retreever.auth.username=admin
retreever.auth.password=change-me
```

With both properties present, Retreever:

* keeps the React UI routes public
* protects the Retreever data APIs such as `/retreever/doc`, `/retreever/ping`, and `/retreever/environment`
* exposes API endpoints at `/retreever/login`, `/retreever/refresh`, and `/retreever/logout`
* issues `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies for the access token, refresh token, and device id
* authenticates protected requests with an internal `OncePerRequestFilter`
* encrypts token payloads with AES-GCM using a startup-generated secret and rotates refresh tokens per session

Retreever generates an in-memory secret at application startup, so tokens become invalid after restart. If neither username nor password is set, auth stays disabled for backward compatibility.

For separate UI development, you can allow credentialed CORS from specific origins:

```properties
retreever.allow-cross-origin=http://localhost:5173
```

Use a comma-separated list to allow multiple explicit origins. Wildcard `*` is not supported because Retreever auth uses cookies.
